# Yelp-Business-Search

### Part 1 (Redis, Cassandra) by Nayoung Park, Part 2 (neo4j) by Siqi (Maggie) Huang

This is the final project for DSC 104, where we designed a search system for restaurants on Yelp runnable as a python script, using Redis, Cassandra and neo4j.
The project is split into two parts, where we find restaurants in a city with given conditions/filters in the first part using Redis and Cassandra, and find restaurants with similar groups of customers/reviews using neo4j.
The restaurants featured in this project are only from 11 major cities that are in the publicly available on Kaggle's Yelp database (https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset, filename: yelp_academic_dataset_business.json).
